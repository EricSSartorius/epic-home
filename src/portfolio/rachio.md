![Rachio](./images/rachio.jpg)

[Rachio](https://www.rachio.com) is a smart sprinkler company that I was contracted by to rehaul their homepage. I used Gatsby.js (The same library used to create this site) and styled components to build the [site](https://www.rachio.com).

- _Update: The lifecycle of the site I developed for Rachio was 1/2018 - 2/2020_
